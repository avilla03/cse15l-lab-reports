1) For installing VS Code, this was quite straightforward. I visited the VS Code website, downloaded the 
MacOS installer, followed the installation instructions, and ran it.

2) To connect to the remote server, it took a bit more work. It required me to search for my course account 
through the UCSD app, then use that to login to the remote server where I needed to input a password. This 
part was a bit tricky for me because the password did not appear to take characters, but after pressing 
enter, it seems that it did indeed register my key strokes.

3) Using commands I learned in the second lecture of CSE 15L, I was able to conduct a few commands to play 
with the server. I learned that cd changes your current directory to the directory you choose. ls is a direct 
consequence of this, as it changes accordingly to a new cd.
